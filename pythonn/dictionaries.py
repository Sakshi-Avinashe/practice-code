# 1. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

# dict={"sak":34,"right":45}
# print(dict)
# print(dict["sak"])

 #Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
# g={"a":4,"v":5}
# k={"w":3}
# g.update(k)
# print(g)

# 3. Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.
# Sample Dictionary :
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30, 4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}


# 5. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.

# dict={"sak":45,"digit":65,"love":53}
# for i in dict:
#   print(dict[i])

# 6. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
# Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
# Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# n=int(input())
# dict={}
# for i in range(1, n+1):
#   dict[i]=i*i
# print(dict)

# 7. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are the square of the keys.
# Sample Dictionary
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}
# n=int(input())
# dict={}
# for i in range(n):
#   dict[i]=i*i
# print(dict)

# 8. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries.
# dict ={"s":1,"d":4,"e":2,"r":7}
# dict2 ={"w":8,"t":9}
# dict.update(dict2)
# print(dict)

# 10. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.
# dict ={"4":1,"5":4,"3":2,"0":7}
# sum=0
# for i in  dict:
#   sum=sum+int(dict[i])
# print(sum)

# 11. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.
# dict ={"4":1,"5":4,"3":2,"0":7}
# m=1
# for i in dict:
#   m=m*int(dict[i])
# print(m)

# 12. Write a Python program to remove a key from a dictionary.
# dict ={"4":1,"5":4,"3":2,"0":7}
# dict.pop("3")
# print(dict)

# 13. Write a Python program to map two lists into a dictionary.
# dict3 ={"4":1,"5":4,"3":2,"0":7}
# dict2 ={"s":1,"d":4,"e":2,"r":7}
# g=dict(zip(dict2+dict3

# dict3 ={"4":1,"5":4,"3":2,"0":7}
# dict2 ={"s":1,"d":4,"e":2,"r":7}
# dict3.update(dict2)
# print(dict3)
